And because we working with HTML code there a lot of / sign. But! You can change the delimiter itself  by clicking on three vertical dots near regex field -and change it manually for any sign ( I chose #), so in a formula field, you will just precisely copy and paste HTML for "matching" without confusion and red marks


2. SetRegOptions on a right corner of regex field - I chose Single Line and Ungreedy and that let me to do metascore :
<div class="clamp-score-wrap">.+<div class="metascore_w large movie positive">(\d+)

3. All that help me to simplify it as possible and I finish with 

a) For Title    class="title"><h3>(.+)</h3>

b) Release date <span>(.+)</span>

c) Description  <div class="summary">\s+(.+)\s+

d)  Metascore <div class="clamp-score-wrap">.+<div class="metascore_w large movie positive">(\d+)</div>

e)  photo URL <td class="clamp-image-wrap">.+<img src="(.+)"

where are:
\s+ ( or \s*)  is any whitespace, which includes spaces, tabs, and newlines ( as Tiffani Vick menshioned above)
(\d+) -  any digit from the Helpful cheat sheet that Vincent Hong provided.
